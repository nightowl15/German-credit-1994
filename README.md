# German-credit-1994
  Two files are of the same german-credit 1994 dataset. Both share the same goals in finding the best algorithm for predicting whether an individual would default in 1994. One is worked on with myself and a partner. The other is redone in my own way. 

This read me file will mostly focus on the project redone in my own way. 

  Exploring German credit 1994 data for practice by applying various algorithms that best predict defaulting. The project uses Rstudio and uses a confusionMatrix for each algorithm finding the missclassification rates, specificity, sensitivity, 95% confidence interval and more. The project assumes that the 1994 German credit data is good quality data. Meaining, the project does not go over reducing model size by removing insignificant predictors, diagnostics such as checking error normality or unusual observations, standarizing the predictors or response variables and further preprocessing steps. Factoring multiple qualitative predictors before running the models was done to test if factoring qualitative predictors would improve model performances. 

There are no visuals yet for the project file redone in my own way.
