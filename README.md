# German-credit-1994
Exploring German credit 1994 data for practice by applying various algorithms that best predict defaulting. The project uses Rstudio and uses a confusionMatrix for each algorithm finding the missclassification rates, specificity, sensitivity, 95% confidence interval and more. The project assumes that the 1994 German credit data is good quality data. Meaining, the project does not go over reducing model size by removing insignificant predictors, diagnostics such as checking error normality or unusual observations, standarizing the predictors or response variables and further preprocessing steps. Factoring multiple qualitative predictors before running the models was done to test if factoring qualitative predictors would improve model performances.
